# nmstranslate
Python based command-line translator for the various languages in No Man's Sky

Starting with the Vy'keen. Repo includes a text rip of the table from the fandom wiki (https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Vy%27keen_(language)) which includes 750+ words translated into three different "dialects". This .txt file is needed to run the program.

Goal is to complete the command-line translator and then make a discord bot which will allow real-time translation right in discord chat.
